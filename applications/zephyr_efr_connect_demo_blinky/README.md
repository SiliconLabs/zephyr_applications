## Summary ##

The example demonstrates how the Zephyr OS is supported by the development kits of Silicon Labs. In this example, you can use a BLE central device to control the LED on the mainboard and receive button press notifications.

## Zephyr version ##

- [Zephyr 4.0.0](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/v4.0.0)

## Hardware Required ##

- 1x [Bluetooth Low Energy Development Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/bluetooth). Tested boards for working with this example:

   | Board ID | Description  |
   | -------- | ------------ |
   | BRD4184B | [SLTB010A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-bg22-kit?tab=overview) EFR32BG22 Thunderboard Kit |
   | BRD2601B | [xG24-DK2601B](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg24-dev-kit?tab=overview) EFR32xG24 Dev Kit |
   | BRD2602A | [xG27-DK2602A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg27-development-kit?tab=overview) EFR32xG27 Development Kit |

- 1x Smartphone runs the Simplicity Connect Mobile App

## Connections Required ##

In this example, the kit connects to a mobile phone via BLE.

- Kit sends the button state to mobile phone
- Kit receives LED control data from mobile phone

## Setup ##

To run the example, you should follow the below steps:

1. Run **Command Prompt** as administrator, initialize the workspace for the project and download the required package, please refer to the [setting up environment](../../README.md#setting-up-environment) section.

2. Change the current working directory to the `zephyrproject` directory using the `cd` command.

3. Build this project by the following commands with each tested board. Make sure to change the board name to the right one that you have.

   - EFR32BG22 Thunderboard Kit - BRD4184B: **`west build -p -b sltb010a zephyr_applications/applications/zephyr_efr_connect_demo_blinky`**
   - EFR32xG24 Dev Kit - BRD2601B: **`west build -p -b xg24_dk2601b zephyr_applications/applications/zephyr_efr_connect_demo_blinky`**
   - EFR32xG27 Dev Kit - BRD2602A: **`west build -p -b xg27_dk2602a zephyr_applications/applications/zephyr_efr_connect_demo_blinky`**

4. Flash the project to the board using **`west flash`** command.

**Note:**

- Make sure that the Zephyr OS environment is already installed. For installing the Zephyr OS environment, you can refer to [this guide](../../README.md#setting-up-environment).

- You need to install the SEGGER RTT J-Link driver to flash this project to the board. For further information, please refer to [this section](../../README.md#flash-the-application).

## How It Works ##

This example implements a simple custom GATT service with two characteristics

- **LED Control**: This characteristic controls the state of the LED (ON/OFF) via write operations from a GATT client.
- **Report Button**: This characteristic sends notifications to subscribed clients when the button state changes (pressed or released).

To test this demo, install Simplicity Connect for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siliconlabs.bledemo&hl=en&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1030932759).

After launching the app go to the 'Demo' tab and select the Blinky demo. A pop-up will show all the devices around you that are running the SoC-Blinky firmware. Tap on the device to go into the demo view.

Tap the light on the mobile app to toggle the LED on the mainboard. When you press/release the button on the mainboard the state changes for the virtual button on the app as well.
